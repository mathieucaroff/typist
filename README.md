# [Custom Typist](https://typist.ea9c.com/)

Typist is a keyboard typing training tool for Custom Keyboard Layouts. You
quickly describe your keyboard layout and the tool will create lessons just
for that layout, starting by the index keys of home row and progressively
adding more keys of the home row, then expanding to the upper and lower row.
